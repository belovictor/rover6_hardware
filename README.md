# ROVER6 Hardware

This repository contains all hardware documentation for my delivery robot project - ROVER6. It is not complete yet as I gradually add documentation here.

### Frame

ROVER6 is built around a main frame which is created using laser cutting and bending 2mm sheet stainless steel.

You will find 3 files for every part of the frame in the frame subfolder - a STEP 3D model, a DXF file for cutting and a PDF file with bending angles specification. There is also an assembly STEP file which contains all components of the frame assembled.
